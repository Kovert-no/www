              Kovert works to deliver quality over quantity, and integrity is in the foundation of our work.
              To push IT security forward, we have taken on a responsibility to keep aquiring new knowledge and skills, and share these with the community.
              For this reason, we actively sponsor conferences, non-profits and individuals who contribute to the community.

              and believes that with targeted work based on our core values, we can achieve this.
