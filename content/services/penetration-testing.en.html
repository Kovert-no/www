                    An external penetration test involves finding weaknesses in your exposed services and infrastructure.
                    Vulnerabilities in your applications and services can be exploited by attackers to gain an initial foothold into your network.

                    An internal penetration test will test the security of your internal network and services.
                    This simulates an attacker who has gained some access to your network, and includes discovery, exploitation and escalation of privileges.

                    If you are looking for a more complete package than a one-off or yearly penetration test, we can help you set up a continous testing program.
                    This will allow us to monitor and test your systems continously, alerting you of new vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
